## Disclaimer and scope

I decided to work with this assignment in the spirit in which it is presented. This is to say the finished solution should solve the required problems but the solution itself is not quite a representation of what a real world appilication would look like or include. Examples of this would be creation of new user id's - instead of using uuid's or something similar I simply went along with iterating on the Id's in the starter data. The starter data itself and the imported xlsx file is also handled in good faith. Meaning the app is not anticipating handling files in a different format or structure. Something which obviously would be a requirement for a production type app. etc etc..

My goal was to solve the required problems using code with a good mix of efficiancy, readability and understandability. Any questions or criticisms regarding this or my choice of scope I would happily answer in further discussions.
